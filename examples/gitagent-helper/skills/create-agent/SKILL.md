# Create & Configure Agents

## Quick Start

1. Create directory structure: `mkdir -p my-agent/skills`
2. Write `agent.yaml` with required fields (see below)
3. Create `SOUL.md` with agent identity
4. Add skills, tools, and knowledge as needed
5. Validate: `gitagent validate -d ./my-agent`

## agent.yaml Reference

### Required Fields
```yaml
spec_version: "0.1.0"
name: my-agent          # Unique identifier
version: 1.0.0          # Semantic version
description: What this agent does
```

### Model Configuration
```yaml
model:
  preferred: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
  fallback:
    - claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
  constraints:
    temperature: 0.2     # 0.0 - 1.0
    max_tokens: 4096
    top_p: 0.9
```

### Skills & Tools
```yaml
skills:
  - code-review          # Must match directory name in skills/
  - security-audit

tools:
  - lint-check           # Must match filename in tools/ (without .yaml)
```

### Runtime
```yaml
runtime:
  max_turns: 20          # Max conversation turns
  timeout: 120           # Seconds
```

### Sub-Agents
```yaml
agents:
  reviewer:
    description: Reviews code quality
    delegation:
      mode: auto
      triggers:
        - "review this"
```

## Writing a Good SOUL.md

A SOUL.md should have these sections:
- **Core Identity** — Who is this agent? One clear sentence.
- **Communication Style** — How does it talk? (direct, friendly, formal, etc.)
- **Values & Principles** — What does it prioritize?
- **Domain Expertise** — What does it know?
- **Collaboration Style** — How does it work with the user?

## Writing RULES.md

Structure as:
- **Must Always** — Non-negotiable behaviors
- **Must Never** — Hard boundaries
- **Output Constraints** — Formatting rules
- **Interaction Boundaries** — Scope limits

## Adding Skills

Create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`:
```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does
license: MIT
allowed-tools: Read Edit Grep
metadata:
  version: "1.0.0"
---

# Instructions
[Detailed instructions for using this skill]
```

## Adding Tools

Create `tools/<name>.yaml`:
```yaml
name: my-tool
description: What this tool does
input_schema:
  type: object
  properties:
    query:
      type: string
      description: Search query
  required:
    - query
```

## Adding Knowledge

Create `knowledge/index.yaml`:
```yaml
documents:
  - path: reference.md
    always_load: true    # Include in system prompt
  - path: appendix.md
    always_load: false   # Available on demand
```
